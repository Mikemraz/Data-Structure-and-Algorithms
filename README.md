# Data structure and algorithms
This repository is intended to implement various data structure and algorithms in python for the purpose of self learning. 
Some programming exercises are also offered to true warriors (with my solution included).


## The resourse/ reference is:
1. [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structure using Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)
interactive online course.
2. "Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews" (Udemy course)
3. "Cracking the Coding Interview" book.
4. Letecode
